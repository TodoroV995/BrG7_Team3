### Health Tweets
### Data Science Brainster Academy Final Project
#### Team 3: Tatjana Veljkovic, Ilija Todorov, Ivana Tomovska Efremov
##### Project Description: the project task is to analyze health related tweets released by 16 different media outlets in the period of 2011 to 2015. Final task is to cluster the health tweets to determine various trends, such as dominating health news topic by media outlet, dominating health news trends through time periods and other related trends. The approach used was text processing by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The dataset was processed using Python Natural Language Toolkit libraries (NLTK). Various clustering methods were used to group/cluster text patterns in order to determine the trends. The dataset can be found in the 'Text Files' folder. 

##### After processing the data (tweets) we used them to confirm health news trends for different years, by different media outlet (source) and we compared two or more media outlets to find similar trends in reporting on health news. 

##### Findings: According to the clients' needs this analysis can be done to compare two or more sources (media outlets) and analysis can be done by year and month in the period of 2011-2015. The analysis can compare similarity between the content of tweets released by a certain media outlet and/or the month and year when it was done. Further analysis can identify top trends and also top terms that were tweeted by media outlet throughout the months in 2011-2015.

##### The word clouds displayed show the most frequent words contained in tweets for each media outlet in the whole of 2014. The findings are consistent with the type of media outlet (national service, NGO or entertainment) and the territory it covers (global vs national). 'Ebola' is still the dominating term in 2014, again because of the big Ebola outbreak in West Afrika in 2014-2016.
